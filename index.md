## Proposal

A .pdf of the formal Project Proposal with complete details can be found [here](https://github.com/elbrandt/CS766_Project/blob/master/proposal/CS766_ElmquistBrandt_Super_Resolution_Image_Enhancement.pdf).

### Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore image super-resolution and understand how creating higher resolution or higher quality pictures can assist in downstream tasks such as object recognition or image segmentation. To understand the effect of super-resolution, we propose implementing a convolutional neural network for super-resolution based on the current state of the art. Beyond recreation of a current algorithm, we will study the general nature of the trained model, and explore the application of super-resolution in object detection accuracy and precision.
